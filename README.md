# Simple Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

The purpose of this project is to learn astrojs through the course [AstroJS 101: Build Blazing Fast Frontends!](https://www.udemy.com/course/astrojs-101-build-blazing-fast-frontends/)

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

I integrated some library and methodology learned on the internet via youtube videos or blogs to have the best place to learn.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
